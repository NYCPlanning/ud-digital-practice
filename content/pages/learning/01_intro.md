# Intro to Urban Design Digital Practice: UDTools and the NYC Digital Twin 
 
Have you heard talk of the “magic machine”, the “miracle box” or the “parametric tool”? This session will demystify the 3D modeling methods used by the Urban Design Office, introduce the tools we’re developing to enable the use of digital urban models at DCP, and lay the groundwork for two future training sessions covering these tools and methods. 

## Audience

- all agency staff who work on (or are interested in) urban design and physical planning issues
- staff who work with designers on neighborhood studies-related CEQR analysis, especially the RWCDS
- staff who may want to collaborate with UD for custom visualization or analysis
- designers who anticipate using UDTools in their work

## Prerequisites

(None)

## Learning Objectives 
 
- Introduce the UD Digital Practice Initiative, its background, and goals 
- Review historic and contemporary examples of urban models; discuss the value and insights models bring to physical planning and urban design 
- Introduce the NYC Digital Twin, a centralized outlet for 3D spatial data 
- Introduce UDTools, which allows Rhino 3D modeling software to: 
  - Connect with the Digital Twin, 
  - “Understand” zoning and urban design concepts, 
  - Generate zoning-compliant massings for real-world or hypothetical sites, 
  - Produce detailed take-offs of key development scenario metrics. 
- Introduce the Digital Practice documentation site, where you can find up-to-date tutorials and information about our products

## Outline

- Introduce the UD Digital Practice Initiative, its background, and goals 
- Review historic and contemporary examples of urban models; discuss the value and insights models bring to physical planning and urban design
- Introduce the NYC Digital Twin, a centralized outlet for 3D spatial data 
- Introduce UDTools, which allows Rhino 3D modeling software to: 
  - Connect with the Digital Twin, 
  - “Understand” zoning and urban design concepts, 
  - Generate zoning-compliant massings for real-world or hypothetical sites, 
  - Produce detailed take-offs of key development scenario metrics. 

- What is the DPI?
  - Past work
    - Soho-Noho
    - Bronx Metro-North
  - Tools vs Methods
  - What this is not: "a magic tool"
  - Tool "ecology" – meant to provide robust but flexible "kit of parts" that can help solve different problems, rather than just performing a specific task
- What is the Digital Twin?
- What is UDTools
  - Extends built-in functionality of Rhino to help with RWCDS modeling, single-site test-fits, environmental analysis and more
  - Makes Rhino "aware" of zoning concepts like the Zoning Lot, rules for height, bulk and use
  - Uses this awareness to:
    1. **Measure** and generate quantity take-offs from Rhino models of proposed developments
    2. **Generate** massings for proposed developemnts according to provided zoning assumptions
  - Different ways of using
    - (planned for the future) web app without Rhino
    - rhino-based with dashboard (main focus)
    - rhino-based with commands (some in sessions 2 and 3) - everything in the dashboard is also provided as a Rhino command, once you're familiar, it may be faster to use UDTools without the dashboard
    - usage with grasshopper (session 4), can access and manipulate low-level functions w/o need for programming knowledge, useful for custom analysis & environmental simulation
  - Dashboard overview, summary of functions/process
    - Context
    - Setup
    - Build
    - Measure
    - Summary
  - *Brief live demo or brief demoing current capabilities*
- Next steps
  - Introduce the Digital Practice documentation site, where you can find up-to-date tutorials and information about our products
    - If you have Rhino available on your computer and want to get started, you can find pre-recorded version of the second session on the docs site.
  - There will be further continuing ed sessions later in the year to walk thorough these "in person"
    - Session 2 – UDTools basics
    - Session 3 – Large models, RWCDS
    - Session 4 - Custom analysis using UDTools data in Grasshopper
  - Repeat, you can always find up-to-date information about what's going on with the DPI via our documentation page:
