> Uses of computation in design—like data visualization, sensors and data analysis, simulation, optimization, procedural modeling, rendering, app design, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Building Information Management (BIM)—are embedded in much of what architects, urbanists, and designers do... From the scale of the project to that of the planet, the uses of computational design methods and tools are most successful when their limits and their contexts...are confronted and surpassed to show us new ways of imagining and creating space. The tools, data, and technology we deploy in the design process are never neutral.
