[Session 1]{.underline}

Introduce DPI products

-   NYC Digital Twin

-   UDTools

What is Open Source/Free Software?

Examples/Precedents

-   ZOLA

-   NYPL Map Warper

    -   Now maintained by Google

-   QGIS

Tools (Software) vs. Methods vs. Data

Key questions:

-   When and how do we transition DPI products from closed-source to
    open-source projects?

-   Will DCP distribute/publish/host any of these tools as ready-to-use
    software, or software-as-a-service?

\-\--

How are DPI products like/unlike Labs products?

-   Similarities

    -   Benefits/depends on other open-source projects

    Differences

    -   Low public visibility

    -   Limited audience (users)

    -   Not "operable" out-of-the-box

The "after-the-fact" problem. Opening something up after the fact is
often undesirable in government as it creates a potential \"exposure
event\" (Fogel)

-   This project started closed-source

-   To be more specific, it didn't start out as a software development
    project at all, rather as methods for using existing software

But, the benefits far outweigh the risks

Risks:

-   Inaccuracies/errors create negative exposure

-   Consultants can steal the code (use freely)

Benefits:

-   Flexible usage

-   Community involvement

-   Cost-savings

-   Reusability

-   Sustainability --Â developer transitions can derail projects

Questions:

-   Labs default license is [Creative Commons Public
    Domain](https://github.com/NYCPlanning/labs-open-source-policy/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

-   Food4rhino example, Grasshopper plug-ins are often free but not
    open-source. why?
