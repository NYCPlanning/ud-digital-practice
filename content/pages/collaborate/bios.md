## Carsten Rodin
Senior Lead Computational Designer
Urban Design Division

Carsten joined DCP just in time for 2020. When he's not developing new tools and methods for the Urban Design Division, you can find him teaching GIS for design students at Columbia GSAPP or exploring the streets of BK Community District 6. He grew up in a Rural Intermediate zone in Skagit County, WA and spent time in an R14 (Poughkeepsie), RD-1 (Oakland), and R7-2 (Harlem) before settling on an R6B district in Carroll Gardens. His favorite NYC book, a 14th birthday present from a cool aunt, is "Please Kill Me: The Uncensored Oral History of Punk."
