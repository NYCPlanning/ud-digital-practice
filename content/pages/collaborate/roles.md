title: Project Roles
---

This document outlines responsibilities and expectations for different roles when working with Digital Practice Initiative tools. Typically, there will be four kinds of project participant: a project manager (PM), users, project support and a development lead. The responsibilities of each are as discussed below.

## Project Manager

- establish a list of project sites and scenarios, including zoning assumptions
- with the zoning division and other stakeholders, establish codified assumptions for zoning for each site
- communicate scenario, site and zoning assumptions to users, oversee creation of rhino model
- supervise data exports and visualization production from model
- with users and other stakeholders, perform quality control prior to major delivery dates

## User(s)

- with the PM, define and input zoning assumptions
- with the PM, define sites, scenarios and zoning designations
- create scenario models in Rhino per project assumptions
- set up and execute data exports from model
- create visualizations from model
- consult documentation when needed to obtain information on process/technique
- submit bug reports and feature requests to the developers [as GitHub issues](/collaborate/issues)

## Development Team

### Project Support

- brief PM and Users on [required inputs](https://nycplanning.github.io/ud-digital-practice/tutorials/quickstart.html#what-you-need) and roles when beginning new projects
- consult with PM to identify anticipated nonstandard analysis or visualization work, and communicate needs to development lead if additional tools or features are needed
- provide instruction and other technical assistance as needed, relying on tutorials and documentation wherever possible
- provide guidance on how to log issues as they arise (see below) and collaborate with the Development Lead to identify temporary workarounds

### Development Lead

- identify reasonable solutions for nonstandard analysis/visualization needs, implement within available timeframe
- in extreme circumstances only, provide patches/updates to core tools as the need arises

The development team is not normally "on call" to fix issues or add features to the core tools as they arise. Any issues, bugs or feature requests **must** be written up as [issues](/collaborate/issues) and will be addressed in future releases on a priority basis.
