# Development Overview

## Project Management

Development occurs through 2-week sprints using an [agile development](https://www.atlassian.com/agile) approach. Communication with stakeholders occurs throughout the process via:

- **Newsletter**  Announce releases and results from previous sprints to broad user group, solicit feedback from user group to discuss with core team.
- **UD Staff Meeting** Provide occasional updates on progress, receive ideas from UD team, discuss high-priority features and plan for one-on-one check-ins.
- **DPI Check-In** Discuss progress, present results, demo new features, and receive guidance on prioritization and strategy.

A running list of issues, features and other tasks is maintained as a [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_ku4IV7c=/) alongside a project timeline.
