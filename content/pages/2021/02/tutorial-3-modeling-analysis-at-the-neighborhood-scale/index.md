summary: Use UDTools for Rhino to document and refine a neighborhood-scale RWCDS.
publishSlug: /tutorials/rhino/module-3
---

### Audience

all agency staff who work on RWCDS analysis, while the second half will cover the methods available to designers for performing the analysis using UDTools.
- Planners and managers involved in the CEQR process for neighborhood studies (pt. 1 only)
- Designers likely to use UDTools for RWCDS work (pts. 1 and 2)



### Prerequisites

- Session 1
- Pt. 2 Only:
  - Session 2
  - Basic familiarity with Rhino, esp. layer management and solid modeling

## Learning Objectives

- Situate UDTools-based RWCDS analysis in the overall CEQR process; review key inputs, outputs and stakeholders
- Discuss recommended project roles and what to expect when working with the DPI team on rezonings
- Review key concepts and recommended practices for urban-scale modeling with UDTools + Rhino
- Review the structure (layers, sites/scenarios) of a basic building-scale model from UDTools 101
- Define custom zoning rules and apply proposed zoning changes spatially in your model
- Define sites and scenarios in bulk from a table or shapefile
- Batch-generate massings for multiple sites at once
- Discuss recommended approaches to iteration, and how to update data exports incrementally

## Outline



- SUMMARY **Export data for use in Excel or GIS**
  - as of the 1.5 release this is broken, unfortunately, but we can see the steps to take anyway
  - jsut one site in this demo, but if we had more than one site this would show a list of all sites in the model
  - shows broad use category total, residential unit count
  - excel sheet can be downloaded, needs special scenario names for rwcds
