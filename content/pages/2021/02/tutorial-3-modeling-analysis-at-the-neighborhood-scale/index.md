title: "Tutorial 3: Modeling & Analysis at the Neighborhood Scale"
summary: Use UDTools for Rhino to document and refine a neighborhood-scale RWCDS.
publishSlug: /tutorials/rhino/module-3
---
### Audience

all agency staff who work on RWCDS analysis, while the second half will cover the methods available to designers for performing the analysis using UDTools.

* Planners and managers involved in the CEQR process for neighborhood studies (pt. 1 only)
* Designers likely to use UDTools for RWCDS work (pts. 1 and 2)

### Prerequisites

* Session 1
* Pt. 2 Only:

  * Session 2
  * Basic familiarity with Rhino, esp. layer management and solid modeling

## Learning Objectives

* Situate UDTools-based RWCDS analysis in the overall CEQR process; review key inputs, outputs and stakeholders
* Discuss recommended project roles and what to expect when working with the DPI team on rezonings
* Review key concepts and recommended practices for urban-scale modeling with UDTools + Rhino
* Review the structure (layers, sites/scenarios) of a basic building-scale model from UDTools 101
* Define custom zoning rules and apply proposed zoning changes spatially in your model
* Define sites and scenarios in bulk from a table or shapefile
* Batch-generate massings for multiple sites at once
* Discuss recommended approaches to iteration, and how to update data exports incrementally

## Outline

- Recap building-scale modeling concepts/techniques
- New concepts:
  - Dimensionality
  - Single source of truth (SSOT)
- Situate UDTools usage for RWCDS definition within larger process for neighborhood studies
  - inputs/outputs
  - stakeholders
  - challenges: iterative process with many variables
- Project roles, what to expect
- Review of model structure, now thinking about dimensionality
  - layers
  - sites/scenarios
- Restore a saved model
- Define custom zoning definitions and boundaries
- Define sites/scenarios in bulk from a CSV table
- Batch-generate massings
  - How to do this with envelope overrides
- Export scenario CSVs and full RWCDS spreadsheet
  * as of the 1.5 release this is broken, unfortunately, but we can see the steps to take anyway
  * just one site in this demo, but if we had more than one site this would show a list of all sites in the model
  * shows broad use category total, residential unit count
  * excel sheet can be downloaded, needs special scenario names for rwcds
- Recommended approaches to iterative/incremental process
