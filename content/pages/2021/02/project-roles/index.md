This document outlines typical roles, responsibilities and expectations when developing RWCDS documentation with UDTools. Use this as a starting point for a conversation about what to expect when beginning a new project.

## Project Team

### Project Manager

- establish a list of sites and scenarios, including general zoning assumptions
- establish specific zoning rules for each proposed district
- communicate scenario, site and zoning assumptions to Designer
- coordinate take-offs (data exports) and model-driven visualizations
- with designer and other stakeholders, perform quality control on all deliverables prior to major deadlines

### Designer

- with the Project Manager, define and sites, scenarios and zoning districts
- with the Project Manager, define any custom zoning rules
- create scenario models in Rhino per project assumptions
- configure and run take-offs (exports) from model
- create visualizations from model
- consult UDTools documentation when needed to get help, or seek guidance from Project Support Liaison
- submit bug reports and feature requests to Development Lead as they arise

## Development Team

### Project Support Liaison

- brief Project Manager and Designer on roles and required inputs when beginning new projects
- consult with Project Manager to identify custom analysis or visualization that may be required, communicate needs to Development Lead
- provide instruction and other technical assistance as needed, relying on tutorials and documentation wherever possible

### Development Lead

- design and implement custom analysis/visualization needs when required
- fix bugs and implement new features requested by the project team (see below)

⚠️ It's important to stress that the development team won't always be able to fix issues or add new features right away. If you think your project might benefit from something that's not already included with UDTools, please feel free to contact us in advance and we can discuss further.
