## Installing UDTools for Rhino

Before installing, make sure you've updated your copy of Rhino to the latest available version. UDTools is compatible with Rhino 6 and 7 on both MacOS and Windows platforms.

### MacOS

1. Download the latest release from [Sharepoint](https://nyco365.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/NYCPLANNING/ud/EpToV_nrVkZLhbH_9nu93xEBxMtwONp9tAb5MKmltODayQ?e=ZeuDHf).
2. Unzip the downloaded folder and double-click `UDTools.machrhi`.
3. The plugin will install (or update). It will be available the next time you use Rhino.

### Windows

1. Download the latest release from [Sharepoint](https://nyco365.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/NYCPLANNING/ud/EpToV_nrVkZLhbH_9nu93xEBxMtwONp9tAb5MKmltODayQ?e=ZeuDHf).
2. Unzip the downloaded folder and double-click `UDTools.rhi`.
3. The plugin will install (or update). It will be available the next time you use Rhino.

⚠️ Important: if you see the message "Windows Defender Firewall has blocked some features of this app" after launching Rhino, make sure the boxes for both Private networks and Public networks are checked and click "Allow access". This will allow UDTools to fetch data from the internet.

### Example Files

Each UDTools release includes example files to help illustrate intended usage for common workflows. We recommend saving these in your user folder or another convenient location of your choice, and replacing the full set whenever you upgrade.
