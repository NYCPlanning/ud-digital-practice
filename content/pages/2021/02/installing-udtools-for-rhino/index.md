## Installing UDTools

Before installing, make sure you've updated your copy of Rhino to the latest available version. UDTools is only compatible with Rhino 6.

### MacOS

1. Download the latest release from [Sharepoint](https://nyco365.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/NYCPLANNING/ud/EpToV_nrVkZLhbH_9nu93xEBxMtwONp9tAb5MKmltODayQ?e=ZeuDHf).
2. Unzip the downloaded folder and double-click `UDTools.machrhi`.
3. The plugin will install (or update). It will be available the next time you use Rhino.

### Windows

1. Download the latest release from [Sharepoint](https://nyco365.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/NYCPLANNING/ud/EpToV_nrVkZLhbH_9nu93xEBxMtwONp9tAb5MKmltODayQ?e=ZeuDHf).
2. Unzip the downloaded folder and double-click `UDTools.rhi`.
3. The plugin will install (or update). It will be available the next time you use Rhino.

⚠️ Important: if you see the message "Windows Defender Firewall has blocked some features of this app" after launching Rhino, make sure the boxes for both Private networks and Public networks are checked and click "Allow access". This will allow UDTools to fetch data from the internet.

### (Optional) Example Files

1. Locate the `examples` folder inside the downloaded release folder.
2. Copy the contents to a folder named `UDTools` in your user folder (`C:/Users/Your_Name` or `Users/Your_Name/` on MacOS).
3. New examples are included with each release, so it's recommended to repeat this step each time you update UDTools.
