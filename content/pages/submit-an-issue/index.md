Requests for technical help should only be made after consulting all relevant sections of the documentation site. If something isn't worknig right and you think you may have discovered a bug, or you have an idea for a new feature or a refinement of an existing one, we want to hear from you!

However, in order to keep track of these in an orderly fashion, we ask that you please submit any requests for development work as an **issue** on GitHub, following the steps below.

- First, go to the [Issue List](https://github.com/NYCPlanning/ud-digital-practice/issues) for the UD Digital Practice Git repository.
- Next, use the search bar toward the top of the screen to do a quick search for keywords to make sure someone else hasn't already logged a similar issue.
- Use the green "New Issue" button at the top right of the page to create a new issue. Give it a descriptive title, and provide the following information in the body:
- It's helpful to spell out **who** you are, **what** you want to do and **why**. Try the following format: "As a (role), I want (goal) so that (reason)."
- If there are relevant technical details you can provide, please include them. But if not, don't worry.
- Include links and screenshots if possible/applicable.

For more details on issues and how we manage them in the development process, see [here](./github-details).

When you're ready, submit your issue to the [tracker](https://github.com/NYCPlanning/ud-digital-practice/issues).
