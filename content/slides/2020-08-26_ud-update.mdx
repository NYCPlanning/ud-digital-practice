## What is the Digital Practice Initiative?

Aims to enhance the work of the Urban Design Office, and the agency as a whole, through the use of computational design **tools** & **data**.

- Expedite time-consuming modeling and analysis workflows
- Enhance contextual awareness to guide decision-making
- Increase transparency and engage the public

<!-- Tools: 3D modeling, gis/spatial data and frontend web technologies -->

**NYC 3D Model**

Downloadable Rhino files of each NYC Community District. Combines 3D building dataset from DOITT and 2D map data from other city sources, like sidewalks, parks, subway entrances.

✅ Convenient 3D view of the city  
✅ Released publicly through OpenData  
❌ Hard to produce  
❌ Hard to update  
❌ Large files discourage casual use
