# Urban Design **Digital Practice Initiative**

Introduction → Counsel, Business Improvement

---

The **Digital Practice Initiative** (DPI) seeks to amplify and enhance the value of urban design and physical planning in NYC, through the development and dissemination of **tools**, **methods** & **data**.

<!-- 

Tools: 3D modeling, gis/spatial data and frontend web technologies 

Expedite time-consuming modeling and analysis workflows
Enhance contextual awareness to guide decision-making
Increase transparency and engage the public

-->

---

We have a vision for how **models** can help designers and planners be more context-aware, work more effectively, and communicate more vividly.

Models, in general:

- Record and store information about places
- Are tangible and intuitive
- Allow us to experiment
- Keep everybody on the same page

---

*Digital* models have the added benefit of encoding things like rules, behavior and change over time. This makes them a powerful tool for physical planning. They can help us:

- **Evaluate zoning**
- **Quantify impact**
- **Coordinate consensus**

<!-- With a well-designed digital model, you can ask it a question and it will give you an answer. These last two points are particularly important for remote work! -->

---

Their main downside is they are not tangible or intuitive like physical models. Digital modeling (as a *practice*) involves specialized **tools**, used together with the right **methods**, to access and manipulate **data**.

**The overarching goal of this work is to make working with digital models as easy as possible.**

<!-- 

How is DCP doing on acheiving a high-quality modeling practice? These are some major milestones in the process we started back in 2017 when the UD office first obtained licenses for the Rhino 3D modeling software, the premiere digital modeling tool used in architecture, engineering and manufacturing.

# **Products**

**NYC Digital Twin**

- Collects multiple Open Data layers in the same place
- Data from DCP, DOITT, Parks, DOT and others
- Provides the basis for spatial understanding of zoning

<!-- 

This is the models-as-data piece

The original 3d model of nyc was released publicly, but was difficult to use, update and contained geometric information only, not fully digital in the sense we need.

The digital twin contains information about street widths, overlays and more that can be read by software and used to better "model" zoning constraints and more

- Provided as a live database service, not files
- Virtual replica of the real-world city
- Versioned data from specific sources
- Easy to update

**NYC Digital Twin**

- Collects multiple Open Data layers in the same place
- Data from DCP, DOITT, Parks, DOT and others
- Provides the basis for spatial understanding of zoning

**DCP is in a singular position to build and maintain this** because it is:

- Specific to NYC
- Based on our own data products (MapPLUTO)
- Not a "scalable" project

**UDTools**

- Adds new functionality to Rhino
- Retrieve data from NYC Digital Twin
- Evaluate zoning in 3D, based on context
- Generate RWC development models
- Calculate impact from key metrics in real time
- Saved file provides a single "source of truth" on large/complex projects

<!-- 

This is where the "rubber meets the road"

**Parametric Tool**

✅ Cut analysis time by 90%  
✅ 3+ neighborhood studies  
❌ Difficult to maintain  
❌ Knowledge lost in last staff transition  
❌ Steep learning curve for new users

# **Broadening Impact**

<!-- As we wrap up the first year of the project, and get into a good pattern of consistent improvements to our products based on feedback from users, we want to think about how to broad  -->

---

DPI's products are designed for NYC, and built around DCP's requirements. But they also create **value for (and with) stakeholders outside the agency**.

---

We want to better understand how we can **maximize value to the agency and the public** in three different arenas:

1. Within city government
2. At the public-private interface
3. In the NYC design community and public at large

In each context, we especially want to consider:

- Who are the potential users?
- Who can contribute?

---

![Audience: All](../assets/2020/12/dpi-audience.svg)

---

![Audience: City Government](../assets/2020/12/dpi-audience-public.svg)

<!-- 

Working with internal stakeholders and a small group of sister agency partners (HPD, EDC) has been a great way to work so far, giving us room to experiment. But the City is increasingly resource-constrained, and we want to look for opportunities to engage both with new user bases and potential project contributors that can help create additional value for the agency.

-->

---

![Audience: Public-Private Interface](../assets/2020/12/dpi-audience-public-private.svg)

<!-- 

We feel that a good next place to start with this could be to explore the "public-private interface". 

Over the summer, we were called on to assist with HPD's Edgemere project, largely because HPD no longer has staff with 3d modeling skills. We identified the possibility that DPI products shared with their consultants could potentially reduce turnaround time for proposal iterations and reduce costs for the city. We want to explore the possibility of a pilot program to explore how tools shared with design firms and other consultants could result in savings for the agency.

-->


---

![Audience: Public](../assets/2020/12/dpi-audience-private.svg)

<!-- 

Contributors here means both data providers and software developers. We want to also adopt a FULLY OPEN-SOURCE DEVELOPMENT MODEL to allow external contributors to help build products that can benefit everyone.

Offering our products to the public for a fee could potentially create a funding stream for the project and help to build capacity. Note that this is not necessarily mutually exclusive with an open-source model.

While design schools lack the resources to contribute meaningfully to the project, making connections with future architects and planners in LOCAL UNIVERSITIES early-on can build our user base.

Partner with tech companies and/or design firms to develop the digital twin.

---

We'd like to meet with you again in the new year to discuss the **benefits and risks of "going public" with our work**.
