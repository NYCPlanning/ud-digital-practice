<!-- The DPI work program builds on previous efforts by David Vega-Barachowitz, Xun Liu and some of our summer interns. This all began in 2017 when the UD office first acquired licenses for Rhino 3D modeling software ‚Äì¬†subsequent efforts focused on providing tools and data to support the work of the Urban Design office within the Rhino environment. When I started at DCP in December 2019, I was left with two projects that have become the foundation of the Digital Practice work. -->

## UDTools Proof-of-Concept

Prototype automation script for Rhino and Excel, originally known as "The Parametric Tool". Used to **automatically generate building models** from provided zoning assumptions, **calculate floor area**, unit counts and other development metrics for RWCDS.

‚úÖ Cut modeling & analysis time by 90%  
‚úÖ Used on three neighborhood studies  
‚ùå Difficult to maintain  
‚ùå Knowledge lost in last staff transition  
‚ùå Steep learning curve for new users  

![UDTools Proof-of-Concept screenshot](../assets/2020-05-17_parametric-tool.gif)

<!-- TOOLS Second, they developed a working prototype of a powerful tool for RWCDS analysis. Was used on Bushwick, North Brooklyn and Bronx Metro-North studies. -->

## 3D Model of NYC

Downloadable Rhino files of each NYC Community District. Combines 3D building dataset from DOITT and 2D map data from other city sources, like sidewalks, parks, subway entrances.

‚úÖ Convenient 3D view of the city  
‚úÖ Released publicly through OpenData  
‚ùå Time-consuming to produce  
‚ùå One-time compilation, hasn't been updated  
‚ùå Large files discourage casual use  

![3D Model of NYC screenshot](../assets/2020-07-08_downloadable-nyc-model.png)

<!-- DATA First, with the help of 2018 summer interns, Urban Design compiled a comprehensive citywide 3d model for Rhino and released it to the public as a set of downloadable files on Open Data... Since we've been working remotely, project teams have found that Rhino models derived from the 3D model are actually too large to use with Sharepoint-->

<!-- 

TOOLS

*EACH USE CASE - NOTATE EXPERTISE REQUIRED, TOOL ECOLOGY 

-->
---

## Single-Site Analysis

- Designers can use UDTools to get real-time feedback on floor area, unit counts and other metrics as they model a site in Rhino
- Uses the Digital Twin as a site model
- Generates a zoning envelope
- Metrics displayed in the Dashboard
- Saves time and resources by speeding the modeling process, allows for comparison of different development scenarios

---

## Multi-Site Analysis

- Project teams on neighborhood studies can use UDTools to partially automate a RWCDS
- UDTools automatically generates massings for each site in the study based on zoning and context from the Digital Twin
- As with the single-site example, it calculates development metrics in real time
- These can be previewed in the Dashboard or exported to Excel for further calculation or consultant coordination

### Details

- 42 sites
- 3 scenarios
- ~500 floors
- ~80 output data points
- **Millions of individual measurements and calculations**
- 90% time savings vs. original method

![use case multisite](../assets/2020-07-10_usecase-multisite.svg)

<!-- 
key facts - how many bldgs, calculations etc. multiplied together , 5,040,000

A well-developed spatial data infrastructure allows for more accurate and complex zoning algorithms. Factors like height of adjacent buildings, street wall continuity and base plane elevation can be taken into account. -->

## Environmental Modeling

- Designers can use UDTools and the Digital Twin in combination with 3rd-party plugins to perform environmental analysis in Rhino
- Shadow studies
- Daylighting and energy consumption analyses
- Pedestrian flow simulations
- Stormwater runoff, wind and air quality simulations
- Can produce cost-savings through reduced reliance on consultants
- Support the possibility of performance-based zoning and other policy tools.

![use case multisite](../assets/2020-07-10_usecase-environmental.svg)

<!-- 

as well as simulations for pedestrian flow, stormwater runoff, wind and building energy usage, can be run within Rhino using the Digital Twin as a site model. In the short-term, bringing some of this work in-house can help the agency save on consultant costs, while in the long-term such tools open the door to performance-based impact metrics that could be reflected in zoning or utilized in evaluating private applications.

Using open-source Grasshopper plugins, we can use the model for:

- Shadow analysis
- Context-dependent environmental analysis & building performance evaluation
- Pedestrian flow simulations -->

## 3D Spatial Analysis

- Designers, in collaboration with Data Engineering, sister agencies or academic partners can contribute design and policy input, as well as unique expertise in 3D data formats, to spatial data analysis projects
- Pursuing a partnership with Mayor's Office of Sustainability to analyze physical characteristics of NYC buildings and identify candidate typologies for standardized energy retrofits across the city
- Analysis projects generate new spatial data which can be fed back into the Digital Twin and enhance visualization and analysis work

## Zoning "Spell Check"

- Applicant teams could use a public release of UDTools to check models for zoning errors before submitting to TRD. 
- Not meant to "rubber-stamp", just to pre-screen for common mistakes
- Cost savings through reduced workload for Technical Review Division.

![use case zoning spellcheck](../assets/2020-07-10_usecase-spellcheck.svg)

<!-- This use case is one of the stronger arguments for a public release of the UDTools plugin ‚Äì¬†it would only work if the tool were in the hands of architects and other applicant team members -->

---

## Digital Drawing + Fabrication

- Designers can use UDTools as a platform for visualization
- Can create time savings in drawing, animation and physical modeling
- Better materials can help facilitate more effective engagement
- Comments from outreach events can be incorporated back into the Digital Twin, creating a feedback loop and building a knowledge base of New Yorkers' views of the built environment

![use case multisite](../assets/2020-07-10_usecase-digitaldrawing.svg)

<!-- 
Rhino is used across the architecture industry not just for formal project documentation and analysis, but also for rendering, illustration, animation and modelmaking. UDTools and the Digital Twin can be used to empower agency designers to be even more effective in thier visual storytelling. Tutorials and additional tools can be developed to partially automate the drawing of buildings and streetscape elements, allowing desingners to focus on human-scale detail that makes our work unique. In the future, the agency could also identify partners or vendors with digital fabrication equipment to quickly and affordably produce physical site models for workshops and community outreach events.

The model can be used to produce complex neighborhood-scale drawings and animations much more quickly than with manual modeling methods. This allows designers to focus more time and energy on drawing what matters.
-->

---

## Interactive Public Engagement

- Urban Design, in collaboration with web developers from Planning Labs or outside partners, can launch interactive online features that extend outreach activities into a virtual space
- Can be closely linked with the Digital Twin, and can invite/collect feedback about specific places
- Can help the agency connect with young people and others who are less likely to participate in formal public meetings

![use case multisite](../assets/2020-07-10_usecase-interactive.svg)

<!-- Finally, the Digital Twin can serve as a backdrop to interactive, location-aware online features that engage residents and increase transparency in the planning process. A wide range of specific applications are possible, ranging from "explainers", virtual participatory planning activities, to community-driven data collection. While developing interactive features is typically resource-intensive, committment to an open-source development partnership from other municipalities, universities or similar stakeholders could advance these goals while avoiding significant budget impacts to DCP. -->

![Work Plan Timeline](../assets/2020-07-10_timeline-development.svg)

<!--
- Continuous, iterative improvements to UDTools
- Pursue internal and interagency collaborations, new use cases
- Seek input from internal stakeholders pre-release
- **Public release of UDTools plugin on 12/9/2020**

Short-term:
continue to test and refine UDTools internally through BK and BX office projects, and with sister agencies (HPD)
refine UDTools & NYC Digital Twin features based on user feedback

Medium-term:
(re)train internal user base on UDTools
seek input from internal stakeholder groups
plan and implement release improvements

Long-term:
After release, engage professional public user base to solicit feedback, refine features
Beyond a professional audience/enhancing transparency: partner with outside organizations, Planning Labs to explore and expand access to NYC Digital Twin for non-professional users.

Input needed from internal stakeholders to identify key issues to address, maximize impact. ITD/Application Development, already have a good relationship and most of what's needed. Also Counsel (potl. liability & IP concerns), Zoning Division. At the same time, we'll continue to work with Borough designers and other internal stakeholders to continuously improve core functionality around zoning, develop documentation and training materials, and train agency designers to take better advantage of digital drawing workflows

## Questions

- Even with a reduced city budget, how might we seek additional resources (i.e. foundation support or other outside funding)?
- What are the agency's current goals/priorities around transparency & public outreach, and how might a spatially-grounded online platform advance those objectives?
- How can we plan for the long-term sustainability of the tools and data developed under this project?
