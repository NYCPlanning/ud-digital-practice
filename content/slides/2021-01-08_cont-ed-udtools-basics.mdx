# **UDTools Basics**

---

We're trying to make working with **3D digital models** for urban design and physical planning **as easy as possible**.

---

## Disclaimer

You're going to hear me say the word **geometry** a lot. In my outline it shows up at least 13 times. I spend a lot of time thinking about this, for better or worse, so please bear with me.

## How many people here work with **GIS**?

<!-- Have you done a lot of digitizing or editing shapes? How does that experience compare with other graphic software? -->

---

## How many people have **BIM** experience, like Revit?

---

## Can anyone offer a definition for GIS or BIM? 

Are these softwares? What makes an ArcGIS document or a Revit model different from a drawing on a PowerPoint slide?

---

## How do we usually model urban spaces in Rhino or Sketchup?

---

## Rhino Geometry Basics

Points, lines, polylines

<!-- Closed polylines are analogous to Polygons in GIS, which can have holes or not. Rhino has different families of "Curves" which include polylines used for representing curvature in 3d space with the highest degree of accuracy possible -->

---

## Rhino Geometry Basics

Surfaces, polysurfaces and meshes

<!--  -->

---

## Attributes

- GIS lets us have editable, feature-level attributes
- Attributes limited to object names in Rhino*
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **UDTools runs inside of Rhino and interprets geometry as special "smart objects" with custom attributes and behaviors**
- You get a familiar, powerful graphic interface for manipulating shapes, with the added benefit of an information-rich model

*\* not 100% true, but let's pretend for clarity*

---

## How does that work?

- Layer Standard
- Defaults and overrides

---

## So what can I do with this?

---

## Questions before we start the demo?
