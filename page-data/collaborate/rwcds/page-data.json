A general idea is fine as long as your entire team agrees. Inside Rhino, you'll be prompted to draw a polygon on a map before running a command to fetch 3d buildings, tax lots and more from DCP GIS servers for you. It doesn't need to be exact; it's a good idea to err on the side of an overly generous boundary that you can trim down later if needed.</p>\n<h3>Site Definition</h3>\n<p>Next, you'll need to define your Sites (\"soft sites\" in RWCDS terminology). The tax lots in your Rhino model will be identified by their Borough-Block-Lot (BBL) number, so sites are defined spatially as a list of BBLs. Each site needs to have a unique identifying number, and can optionally be assigned to a <code>group</code> (used for Projected/Potential in RWCDS) or be given a <code>note</code>. The different Scenarios in your project (understood as a single possible moment in the past, present or future) are also defined here, along with the assumed zoning under each. Your table will look like this:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>site_id</th>\n<th>lot_ids</th>\n<th>group</th>\n<th>zoning<em>SCN</em>Existing</th>\n<th>zoning<em>SCN</em>Without_Action</th>\n<th>zoning<em>SCN</em>With_Action</th>\n<th>note</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>2039430207, 2039430208</td>\n<td>Projected</td>\n<td>M1-1</td>\n<td>M1-1</td>\n<td>C4-3</td>\n<td>Please review WOA zoning</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>...</td>\n<td>...</td>\n<td>...</td>\n<td>...</td>\n<td>...</td>\n<td>...</td>\n<td>...</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Zoning Assumptions</h3>\n<p>For <strong>every</strong> zoning district specified in your site definition table, you'll need to provide a list of basic assumptions. This should be developed in collaboration with the Zoning Division and Urban Design. Your zoning assumptions will look like this:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>district</th>\n<th>...</th>\n<th>residential_far</th>\n<th>...</th>\n<th>commercial_parking</th>\n<th>...</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>R4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>0.75</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>...</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>...</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>...</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Note that every parameter for each district entry needs to have a value, blanks will cause the script to fail.</p>\n<h3>Data Export Template (Optional)</h3>\n<p>By default, the script will create a data export of all calculated site information for each scenario using the standard table provided for RWCDS consultants. If you need only a subset of the full range, you can provide your own list of fields to use in a text file. The full list of available fields is available <a href=\"../developer/data-model\">here</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":"/collaborate/rwcds","title":"What You Need"}}},"pageContext":{"layout":"default","slug":"/collaborate/rwcds"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
